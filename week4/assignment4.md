### Assignment 4

Refactoring is the process of restructuring an existing body of code to improve its internal structure and quality without altering its external behavior.

This week we are going to refactor your assignment from week 2. 

Requirements:
- Use main function
- Define some constants at the top of your program.
- Define at least one function that takes arguments and returns a value

Think about the following:
- What can be modularized as a function?
- What makes sense to be defined as local/global variables?
- How can you structure your code so that it is easier/faster for someone to grasp what is going on? (for example, break down your code into multiple scenes)
- Is it easier to test and debug your code now?

Pay attention to:
- Naming conventions
- Try to avoid very long code inside 
- Write comments to explain your code
- Beautify your code inside PyCharm : In the main menu, go to **Code | Reformat Code**

* If your game is rather simple, or if you were already using functions. Try to expand it a bit more to practice refactoring and fulfill the above requirements with it.
