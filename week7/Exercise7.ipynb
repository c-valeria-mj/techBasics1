    "## File Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading and writing files are very common tasks that come in handy in programming. You can write a program to **read** data from files and also **write** computed results to files. This provides us with the basic infrastructure to process large amount of data in a few seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we will deal *text files*. They are files that only consists of lines of text without formatting information. For example, word documents or pages files are not *text files*, the formatting information contained in them can make handling them in a program more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with files in Python, you need to open the file first. The built-in `open()` function does what the name implies - it opens a file and returns it as a file object. So to use the `open()` function, you would need to save the returned value to a variable, so that you can access the opened file later.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the file is opened, you can use the `.read()` method to read content from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to always close the file with `.close()` method after you are done. Closing files on time helps to protect you from potential data loss. Also, an opened file prevents other processes from accessing the same file until your current program terminates.\n",
