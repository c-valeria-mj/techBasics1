## Assignment 3
**DUE 28 April Monday Noon**

This week we want to make a more complicated ASCII art design by integrating new concepts/tools we have learned in the past two weeks:

- Take at least three user inputs to generate your ASCII, two of them should be integers, one of them being a string
- Come up with interesting ways to integrate user inputs into the final ASCII result (provide good instructions and constraints so that it is both fun and not too easy to break your code!)
- Your code should include at least one set of nested loops and one conditional statement
- Use `random` and list together to introduce some randomness for the same user inputs
- You can either create this assignment based on the ASCII art you made in week 1 or create something completely new

Bonus
- Add unexpected behavior or personal flair
- How to animate the generated result with minimal effort?

Potential Ideas (to help you get started)
- Make your design modular, so that you can use the user input to tile it (width/height/repetitions...)
