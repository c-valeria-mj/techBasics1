### Assignment 2 

Create a little text game satisfying the following requirements:
- Include at least 10 conditional statements and 5 user inputs. 
- At least one conditional statement is nested within another conditional statement
- One of the user input should be a number within a particular range, your code shall verify if the user input is 1) a valid number 2) within the range that you define. If the user input doesn't satisfy the requirement, ask for input again
- Use time delays to improve the interactive experience
- There should be at least one branching point where user inputs lead to different path
- save it as `game.py`

Bonus
- Add typing effects to some of your print functions to add suspense
- Remember that you have all the UTF-8 characters at your disposal, so be creative and go wild!
